# Template Node tutorial

This was a tutorial using ejs to template views in Node. I added to it by creating an instant chat feature using web sockets, and a few pages playing around with some cool interactive CSS.

## The application includes: 

- Home page with full width
- About page with sidebar
- Chat page with instant messaging
- Football page to search for match scores using API (unfinished)
- Screamer & Play pages with css

## Technologies used:

- Node
- Javascript
- WebSockets
- HTML5
- EJS
- CSS3

## How to run the server:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/imarkwick/node_steps.git
$ cd node_steps
$ npm install -d
$ npm start
```
